## Overview

I recently built my personal portfolio website over two days, focusing on keeping the process straightforward and efficient. Rather than overcomplicating the project, I aimed to create a clear, maintainable site that represents my work accurately.

## Tech Stack and Workflow

- **Frontend Hosting:** [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- **Domain Management:** [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- **Email (Contact Form & Newsletter):** [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- **UI Design & Component Styling:** [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) + [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.dev/)
- **CSS Framework:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Framework:** [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)

### Key Features

- Fully responsive design
- Blog and Projects that are easily editable
- Markdown files converted to HTML for blog and project content to avoid repetitive HTML/CSS work
- Animated bird flying across the top page
- Smooth parallax backgrounds and scroll effects
- Contact form and newsletter signup integrated with Resend
- Clean and simple UI, composed with v0.dev and Shadcn components
- Custom domain set up through AWS Route 53

## Development Breakdown

- **Day 1:**
  - Defined the UI layout and page structure
  - Adjusted and finalized the UI using v0.dev and Shadcn components
  - Set up TailwindCSS and basic styling

- **Day 2:**
  - Deployed the frontend to AWS Amplify
  - Linked the contact form and newsletter features to Resend
  - Configured a custom domain using AWS Route 53
  - Finalized minor styling adjustments and tested responsiveness

The two-day development timeline was manageable because of a straightforward workflow and familiarity with the tools used. Even with some additional refinements, the project could easily be completed within three days.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build a complete and maintainable site within a short time frame
- Focus on clarity and simplicity in both design and development
- Integrate external services like Resend smoothly
- Handle domain setup, project deployment, and site operation independently

If you're thinking about creating your own portfolio and would like some help, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to discuss and support your project.

# Learning Singapore’s Birds by Ear: A Look at the SingBirds Call Quiz

## Overview

SingBirds Call Quiz is an interactive web application that challenges players to identify bird species by their songs. The game is centered around birds found in **Singapore**, making it both a fun and educational experience.

Players view a **spectrogram** of a bird call and listen to the audio recording before choosing the correct bird species from multiple-choice options. After submitting an answer, they can view detailed information and a photo of the bird.

---

## Features

- 🎧 **Bird Call Audio**: Listen to real bird recordings.
- 📈 **Spectrogram Display**: Visualize bird calls using spectrograms.
- ❓ **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Pick the correct species from a list of options.
- 📝 **Detailed Feedback**:
  - See which birds you identified correctly or incorrectly.
  - Access bird information via Wikipedia API after answering.
  - View bird images dynamically pulled from Wikipedia.
- 🌎 **Hotspot and Country Selection**: Select specific countries (currently only Singapore) and birding hotspots.
- 🎚️ **Adjustable Quiz Settings**: Set the number of questions.
- 📊 **Quiz Result Summary**: Review your score, accuracy, and species performance.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

### Backend
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with Django REST Framework
- Custom APIs serving species lists, hotspot data, and bird observation records

### Audio Processing
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) for audio analysis
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for spectrogram generation

---

## Data Sources

- **eBird API**:
  - Retrieves Singapore hotspots
  - Gets bird species observed at hotspots over the past 30 days (snapshot taken in October)

- **Xeno-Canto API**:
  - Provides bird song recordings
  - Filters recordings with **Quality A** and durations between **0–30 seconds**

- **Wikipedia API**:
  - Fetches species descriptions and images dynamically

---

## App Flow

1. Player selects a country (currently only Singapore) and a hotspot.
2. App retrieves a list of birds based on recent observations (snapshot taken in Oct 2024).
3. Spectrogram and audio are displayed.
4. Player submits an answer.
5. App shows feedback, Wikipedia information, and bird photo.
6. After the quiz, a final score and breakdown are shown.



Made with ❤️ for bird lovers around the world.
